# Dependabot configuration for RFS Station Manager
# Documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file
#
# This configuration manages automated dependency updates for:
# - npm packages in root workspace (/)
# - npm packages in backend (/backend)
# - npm packages in frontend (/frontend)
# - GitHub Actions workflows (/.github/workflows)
#
# Best Practices Applied:
# - Grouped updates to reduce PR spam
# - Separate handling of production and development dependencies
# - Security-focused patch updates
# - Version pinning strategies to minimize breaking changes
