**📖 For detailed setup instructions, see [Getting Started Guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)**

## 🗺️ Application Routes

The application uses a feature-based routing structure for scalability:

- **`/`** - Landing page with overview of all features
- **`/signin`** - Station member sign-in system (current functionality)
- **`/truckcheck`** - Vehicle maintenance tracking (placeholder for future feature)

Additional features can be easily added as new routes following this pattern.

## 📱 Usage

### Sign In
1. Search or scroll to find your name
2. Tap your name to check in
3. See yourself appear in "Currently Signed In"
4. Tap again to undo check-in

### Change Activity
1. Click on an activity button (Training, Maintenance, Meeting)
2. Or create a custom activity
3. All new check-ins will use the selected activity

### Add New Members
1. Click "+ Add New Member"
2. Enter the member's name
3. They'll appear in the member list with a unique QR code

```

### Feature-Based Routing

The application follows a scalable feature-based routing pattern:

1. **Landing Page (`/`)**: Central hub displaying all available features
2. **Feature Routes (`/feature-name`)**: Each major feature has its own route
3. **Feature Modules**: Self-contained feature directories with components and styles

**Adding a New Feature:**
1. Create a new directory in `frontend/src/features/your-feature`
2. Add `YourFeaturePage.tsx` and `YourFeaturePage.css`
3. Register the route in `App.tsx`
4. Add a feature card to the landing page

### Scripts

**Development with Sample Data (In-Memory Database):**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Development with Production Database:**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev:prod

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Backend:**
```bash
npm run dev       # Development with sample data (in-memory)
npm run dev:prod  # Development with production database
npm run build     # Build TypeScript
npm start         # Run production build
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:ui      # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report
```

**Backend:**
```bash
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Tests

The application includes comprehensive automated test coverage:

**Frontend Tests (Vitest + React Testing Library):**
- 80+ tests covering components, hooks, and pages
- 93%+ code coverage (statements, branches, functions)
- Tests for:
  - Core components (ActivitySelector, MemberList, ActiveCheckIns, Header, EventCard)
  - Feature pages (LandingPage)
  - Custom hooks (useSocket, useTheme)
  - User interactions and state management

**Backend Tests (Jest + Supertest):**
- 45+ integration tests covering all API endpoints
- Tests for members, activities, check-ins, events, truck checks, and achievements
- In-memory database for fast, isolated tests

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm test              # Run all tests once
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report

# Backend
cd backend
npm test              # Run all tests once
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
```

**CI/CD Testing:**
- All tests run automatically in GitHub Actions on every PR
- Frontend and backend tests run in parallel
- Build only proceeds if all tests pass
- Coverage reports uploaded as artifacts

### Manual Testing

Open multiple browser windows to `http://localhost:5173` and test real-time synchronization:
- Check in on one device, see update on others
- Change activity, see it reflected everywhere
- Add a member, appears for all users

## 🔒 Security

The Station Manager implements multiple layers of security protection:

### Security Headers (Helmet)
- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**: Protects against XSS and injection attacks
  - Restricts resource loading to same-origin by default
  - Allows WebSocket connections for real-time features
  - Permits inline styles required by React
- **X-Frame-Options: DENY**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: Privacy-focused referrer control
- **Permissions-Policy**: Blocks camera, microphone, geolocation, payment APIs
- **HSTS**: Enforces HTTPS in production (1 year max-age)
- **X-Powered-By**: Hidden to avoid revealing server technology

### Network Security
- **HTTPS Required**: All production traffic uses HTTPS
- **WSS (WebSocket Secure)**: Encrypted WebSocket connections in production
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted to specific frontend URL
- **Trust Proxy**: Configured for Azure App Service

### Input Security
- **Input Validation**: express-validator on all POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints
- **XSS Protection**: HTML entity escaping for user input
- **Type & Length Validation**: Enforced on all fields
- **Pattern Validation**: Name fields restricted to safe characters
- **Whitespace Trimming**: Automatic sanitization

### Rate Limiting
- **API Routes**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Auth Routes**: 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP (reserved for future)
- **SPA Fallback**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Standard Headers**: RateLimit-* headers for client feedback

### Data Protection
- **No Sensitive Data**: QR codes contain only member IDs
- **Environment Variables**: Secrets not committed to version control
- **Azure Key Vault**: For production secrets (recommended)

### Testing
- **27 Security Header Tests**: Comprehensive validation of all headers
- **25 Input Validation Tests**: Coverage of all validation rules
- **100% Test Pass Rate**: All security tests passing

For detailed security configuration, see [Security & Authentication](docs/AS_BUILT.md#security--authentication) in the as-built documentation.

Future enhancements may include optional authentication for admin functions.
